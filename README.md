# log-inspector
Clone the git repo : git clone https://github.com/shukric09/log-inspector.git
Open the project in editor or use command line, to run project pass the logfile.txt path in command line arguments.

Instead of using HSQLDb I have flagged all events/alerts in an output file. The output file directory is configurable and can be passed in loginspector.properties.
